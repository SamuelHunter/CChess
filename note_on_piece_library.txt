although piece_library.json may appear to have no logic...
this is how i wanted it to read:


"K": {				//piece uses char 'K'
				//make sure to use uppercase or program won't identify a matching piece on the board

    "name": "King",		//proper name
				//will be re-written in all lowercase or all uppercase to show side

    "initial": [],		//ADDITIONAL moves available if piece is in starting position and never moved
				//do not list offsets that already appear in move!

    "move": [			//array of move offsets in the form [forward, right]
      [1, 0],			//an optional third component, range is allowable and assumed to be 1
      [1, 1],			//[1, -1, -1] means infinite range in the up-left direction
      [0, 1],
      [-1, 1],
      [-1, 0],
      [-1, -1],
      [0, -1],
      [1, -1]
    ],

    "capture": "move"		//instead of copying the moves array,
				//the parser will recognize the string name of another and follow it instead
				//unlike initial, captures is INDEPENDENT of moves and will not automatically be the same
  },
